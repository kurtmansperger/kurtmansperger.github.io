      <h3>Technology leader, educator, and advocate.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>I'm running for the 2-year Amesbury School Committee seat because I'm passionate about public education and I believe that everyone deserves access to a high-quality education. My wife and I moved to Amesbury seven years ago and have loved calling it our home ever since. We're also parents to a son who will be attending Amesbury Public Schools in the coming years.</p>

      <p>I have a proven track record of leading change through thoughtful collaboration with a variety of stakeholders and by simplifying complex concepts into something everyone can understand. In my previous roles, I consulted with states to build eligibility systems, taught people to code, coached people through early career transitions, and most recently served as the Chief Technology Officer for the Boston Public Library. Throughout my experience, I've learned the importance of listening to all viewpoints and prioritizing impact. I would do the same as a member of the School Committee.</p>      
      
      <p>Another area where I can add substantial value is within the finance subcommittee and budget review. My most recent position at the Boston Public Library involved managing a department budget, which I significantly expanded by securing additional federal funding and collaborating closely with our foundation to increase targeted donations. Furthermore, I have a track record of successfully managing finances in my coding education business and serving as treasurer for two non-profit organizations.</p>
      
      <p>I also bring a wealth of experience with the FCC's e-rate program, which provides crucial funding to both schools and libraries. My past experience has given me in-depth exposure and expertise in how to maximize e-rate benefits for educational institutions.</p>
      
      <p>I'm committed to working with the school committee and the community to ensure that all students in Amesbury have access to a high-quality education. I also believe investing in public education is crucial to the ongoing success of our city.</p>
            
      <p>I hope to have your support in November. If you have any questions or would like to discuss anything in more detail, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
